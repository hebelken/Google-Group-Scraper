- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- "Just an update: I sort of combined all of your suggestions for my C working environment. I''m using Notepad++ for my text editor (thanks Matthew) and Cygwin and a GCC compiler to compile and run my programs. Thanks again for your help guys! Happy Holidays."
- "Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error \"cygwin1.dll is missing\" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- "Just an update: I sort of combined all of your suggestions for my C working environment. I''m using Notepad++ for my text editor (thanks Matthew) and Cygwin and a GCC compiler to compile and run my programs. Thanks again for your help guys! Happy Holidays."
- "Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error \"cygwin1.dll is missing\" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- "Just an update: I sort of combined all of your suggestions for my C working environment. I''m using Notepad++ for my text editor (thanks Matthew) and Cygwin and a GCC compiler to compile and run my programs. Thanks again for your help guys! Happy Holidays."
- "Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error \"cygwin1.dll is missing\" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now.

With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

After reviewing these slides, it looks like we need to do some major edits. We have 76 slides for a ~35 minute presentation. I ask all of you to cut down your parts of the presentation to *5 slides*. This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

Who & How do you ensure that the changes are implemented? 5. what are the actions taken when there is a change in your scope or quality or requirements? 6. who will do the analysis for changes? 7. who will approve or deny the changes? 8. Does the changes are documented? is there any change control form? 9. what are the impacts due to changes? 10. Does ECM have change control procedures? 11.

 All, I look forward to giving our presentation tonight. Attached is the final copy -- please let me know ASAP if you have any changes. I scheduled a room tonight, 25 East Pearson Maguire Hall (the same building where we have class) room *417*. I will be there as close to 5 PM as possible to review the presentation with all that can attend. I will take 1st and 2nd slides, the budget section, lessons learned, and the questions slide. Everyone else will have their respective sections. See you tonight, Pete

 Hi Everyone:Here is the paper as of now.  There are still a lot of sentences that start with prepositions, passive sentences and verb tense disagreements.  I will continue working on the paper this evening and will send it out with as much as I can possible fix over the course of the evening.  I will add more to my critique section.  Please check your section and make sure the references are correct and that the Appendix references are correct.  Do not make your changes in the paper but simply email them to me as I will continue to make grammar changes.  Ken, please make sure all the citations in the Reference section are correct.Mitch', '2010-11-22 17:45:01', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/f62db74e89e5c7af/4cc6580cf2157345?show_docid=4cc6580cf2157345', 1, 6)[0m

 All, Attached are the slides that Theja sent out earlier. After reviewing these slides, it looks like we need to do some major edits. We have 76 slides for a ~35 minute presentation. I ask all of you to cut down your parts of the presentation to *5 slides*. This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

 All, attached is the final version of our paper with the Executive Summary. Please be aware that all edits to this paper are due *this Sunday 7/12.* This is an important date to hit as Mitch will be compiling all edits to the paper and performing the final edit before we print this. I will be assisting him with this process. Please read the entire paper and make changes as appropriate. There is a lot of grammar that needs to be corrected as well as a deeper analysis of some sections. Each section should contain a closing paragraph where it is discussed what went right, what went wrong, and how it could be better. If your section does not have this information please add it by this Sunday. "Track Changes" is turned on for the document so any change you make will be marked red. Please keep this tracking on, save the document with a unique filename, and send to Mitch. Again,    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow making changes you    feel are necessary.    - By this Sunday night please post any changes you have to the Google    Group website and label the filename with your initials. Email the project    team letting Mitch and myself know that your section is complete. This is a    critical time to hit -- please do not miss this date.    - Please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Wednesday night    7/15 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. ***I pushed this date    back because we will not be presenting our analysis this Wednesday and this    will leave you more time to focus on the editing of the final paper.*** Thanks, Peter

 Hi Peter, Following are the questions regarding project control and tracking, 1. How the issues in ECM project are solved? whether a plan is prepared to solve it? 2. who will solve the issues? How do you allocate the time to solve it? 3. How the changes in ECM project are informed to team members? who notifies it? 4. Who & How do you ensure that the changes are implemented? 5. what are the actions taken when there is a change in your scope or quality or requirements? 6. who will do the analysis for changes? 7. who will approve or deny the changes? 8. Does the changes are documented? is there any change control form? 9. what are the impacts due to changes? 10. Does ECM have change control procedures? 11. Is there any change control board? if so, what are their responsibilities? 12. Is there any freeze date? 13. is there any project methodology? As a project manager what is your opinion about the methodology? is it useful? 14. is there any gating process? Once I get the answers for these questions, I will update the document. Regarding the project methodologies and templates, I searched in luc website, but it says that FILE NOT VIEWABLE by the public. so could you send me the document. -- Thank you so much, Thejashree Sengodan ', '2010-11-22 17:45:07', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/ccdb29592d0c4d1a/6541eb971e1a5685?show_docid=6541eb971e1a5685', 1, 5)[0m

 All, I look forward to giving our presentation tonight. Attached is the final copy -- please let me know ASAP if you have any changes. I scheduled a room tonight, 25 East Pearson Maguire Hall (the same building where we have class) room *417*. I will be there as close to 5 PM as possible to review the presentation with all that can attend. I will take 1st and 2nd slides, the budget section, lessons learned, and the questions slide. Everyone else will have their respective sections. See you tonight, Pete

 All, Attached are the slides that Theja sent out earlier. After reviewing these slides, it looks like we need to do some major edits. We have 76 slides for a ~35 minute presentation. I ask all of you to cut down your parts of the presentation to *5 slides*. This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

 All, attached is the final version of our paper with the Executive Summary. Please be aware that all edits to this paper are due *this Sunday 7/12.* This is an important date to hit as Mitch will be compiling all edits to the paper and performing the final edit before we print this. I will be assisting him with this process. Please read the entire paper and make changes as appropriate. There is a lot of grammar that needs to be corrected as well as a deeper analysis of some sections. Each section should contain a closing paragraph where it is discussed what went right, what went wrong, and how it could be better. If your section does not have this information please add it by this Sunday. "Track Changes" is turned on for the document so any change you make will be marked red. Please keep this tracking on, save the document with a unique filename, and send to Mitch. Again,    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow making changes you    feel are necessary.    - By this Sunday night please post any changes you have to the Google    Group website and label the filename with your initials. Email the project    team letting Mitch and myself know that your section is complete. This is a    critical time to hit -- please do not miss this date.    - Please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Wednesday night    7/15 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. ***I pushed this date    back because we will not be presenting our analysis this Wednesday and this    will leave you more time to focus on the editing of the final paper.*** Thanks, Peter

 Hi Peter, Following are the questions regarding project control and tracking, 1. How the issues in ECM project are solved? whether a plan is prepared to solve it? 2. who will solve the issues? How do you allocate the time to solve it? 3. How the changes in ECM project are informed to team members? who notifies it? 4. Who & How do you ensure that the changes are implemented? 5. what are the actions taken when there is a change in your scope or quality or requirements? 6. who will do the analysis for changes? 7. who will approve or deny the changes? 8. Does the changes are documented? is there any change control form? 9. what are the impacts due to changes? 10. Does ECM have change control procedures? 11. Is there any change control board? if so, what are their responsibilities? 12. Is there any freeze date? 13. is there any project methodology? As a project manager what is your opinion about the methodology? is it useful? 14. is there any gating process? Once I get the answers for these questions, I will update the document. Regarding the project methodologies and templates, I searched in luc website, but it says that FILE NOT VIEWABLE by the public. so could you send me the document. -- Thank you so much, Thejashree Sengodan ', '2010-11-22 17:49:54', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/ccdb29592d0c4d1a/6541eb971e1a5685?show_docid=6541eb971e1a5685', 1, 5)[0m

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability.

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-11-22 17:51:06', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 2, 18)[0m

 Steve, I would recommend that you go to http://www.cygwin.com/ and click on "Install Cygwin now". "Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows." "Note that Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the 1.7 version of Cygwin." Hopefully you don''t have Windows 7. From the setup program choose the compliers and text editors that you want. I believe "nano" is an easy text editor to use.Good luck, MarkOn Dec 14, 12:31 am, Joseph Kaylor <joekay...@gmail.com> wrote:', '2010-11-22 17:51:06', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 2, 20)[0m

 Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error "cygwin1.dll is missing" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability.

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-11-22 17:56:11', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 9)[0m

 Steve, I would recommend that you go to http://www.cygwin.com/ and click on "Install Cygwin now". "Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows." "Note that Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the 1.7 version of Cygwin." Hopefully you don''t have Windows 7. From the setup program choose the compliers and text editors that you want. I believe "nano" is an easy text editor to use.Good luck, MarkOn Dec 14, 12:31 am, Joseph Kaylor <joekay...@gmail.com> wrote:', '2010-11-22 17:56:11', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 11)[0m

 Thanks guys!

 Just an update: I sort of combined all of your suggestions for my C working environment. I''m using Notepad++ for my text editor (thanks Matthew) and Cygwin and a GCC compiler to compile and run my programs. Thanks again for your help guys! Happy Holidays.

 Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error "cygwin1.dll is missing" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability. I would like to have something presentable by April''s Chicago GTUG Here are some resources that I would like to begin with http://www.damonkohler.com/2009/02/android-recipes.html http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>No matter your level of expertise, If you are interested send me an email.  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>  Matthew K Wojtowicz Loyola Research Assistant Android Developer Mail: matt...@gmail.com Phone: +1(773)413-0202 Skype: mwojtow0202 ', '2010-11-22 18:09:23', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/2267df1e5fd8464b/e9051a923c15f593?show_docid=e9051a923c15f593', 1, 6)[0m

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-11-22 18:09:25', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 9)[0m

 Steve, I would recommend that you go to http://www.cygwin.com/ and click on "Install Cygwin now". "Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows." "Note that Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the 1.7 version of Cygwin." Hopefully you don''t have Windows 7. From the setup program choose the compliers and text editors that you want. I believe "nano" is an easy text editor to use.Good luck, Mark', '2010-11-22 18:09:25', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 11)[0m

 I just realized that I forgot to share the code for this project with everyone. I haven''t set up in google code yet because the state of the code isn''t very good, but I''ve created a site in Google Sites with the prototype version. You can find that site here:http://sites.google.com/site/msilgc/If this project ever progresses further than where it stands right now, I''ll keep this site up to date.-joe', '2010-11-22 18:09:27', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/a828228d2f8e075d/ff94fac821d3868f?show_docid=ff94fac821d3868f', 1, 10)[0m

 All, I look forward to giving our presentation tonight. Attached is the final copy -- please let me know ASAP if you have any changes. I scheduled a room tonight, 25 East Pearson Maguire Hall (the same building where we have class) room *417*. I will be there as close to 5 PM as possible to review the presentation with all that can attend. I will take 1st and 2nd slides, the budget section, lessons learned, and the questions slide. Everyone else will have their respective sections. See you tonight, Pete

 Hi Everyone:Here is the paper as of now.  There are still a lot of sentences that start with prepositions, passive sentences and verb tense disagreements.  I will continue working on the paper this evening and will send it out with as much as I can possible fix over the course of the evening.  I will add more to my critique section.  Please check your section and make sure the references are correct and that the Appendix references are correct.  Do not make your changes in the paper but simply email them to me as I will continue to make grammar changes.  Ken, please make sure all the citations in the Reference section are correct.Mitch', '2010-11-22 18:10:41', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/f62db74e89e5c7af/4cc6580cf2157345?show_docid=4cc6580cf2157345', 2, 19)[0m

 All, Attached are the slides that Theja sent out earlier. After reviewing these slides, it looks like we need to do some major edits. We have 76 slides for a ~35 minute presentation. I ask all of you to cut down your parts of the presentation to *5 slides*. This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

 All, attached is the final version of our paper with the Executive Summary. Please be aware that all edits to this paper are due *this Sunday 7/12.* This is an important date to hit as Mitch will be compiling all edits to the paper and performing the final edit before we print this. I will be assisting him with this process. Please read the entire paper and make changes as appropriate. There is a lot of grammar that needs to be corrected as well as a deeper analysis of some sections. Each section should contain a closing paragraph where it is discussed what went right, what went wrong, and how it could be better. If your section does not have this information please add it by this Sunday. "Track Changes" is turned on for the document so any change you make will be marked red. Please keep this tracking on, save the document with a unique filename, and send to Mitch. Again,    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow making changes you    feel are necessary.    - By this Sunday night please post any changes you have to the Google    Group website and label the filename with your initials. Email the project    team letting Mitch and myself know that your section is complete. This is a    critical time to hit -- please do not miss this date.    - Please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Wednesday night    7/15 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. ***I pushed this date    back because we will not be presenting our analysis this Wednesday and this    will leave you more time to focus on the editing of the final paper.*** Thanks, Peter

 Hi Peter, Following are the questions regarding project control and tracking, 1. How the issues in ECM project are solved? whether a plan is prepared to solve it? 2. who will solve the issues? How do you allocate the time to solve it? 3. How the changes in ECM project are informed to team members? who notifies it? 4. Who & How do you ensure that the changes are implemented? 5. what are the actions taken when there is a change in your scope or quality or requirements? 6. who will do the analysis for changes? 7. who will approve or deny the changes? 8. Does the changes are documented? is there any change control form? 9. what are the impacts due to changes? 10. Does ECM have change control procedures? 11. Is there any change control board? if so, what are their responsibilities? 12. Is there any freeze date? 13. is there any project methodology? As a project manager what is your opinion about the methodology? is it useful? 14. is there any gating process? Once I get the answers for these questions, I will update the document. Regarding the project methodologies and templates, I searched in luc website, but it says that FILE NOT VIEWABLE by the public. so could you send me the document. -- Thank you so much, Thejashree Sengodan ', '2010-11-22 18:10:50', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/ccdb29592d0c4d1a/6541eb971e1a5685?show_docid=6541eb971e1a5685', 2, 18)[0m

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability. I would like to have something presentable by April''s Chicago GTUG Here are some resources that I would like to begin with http://www.damonkohler.com/2009/02/android-recipes.html http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>No matter your level of expertise, If you are interested send me an email.  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>  Matthew K Wojtowicz Loyola Research Assistant Android Developer Mail: matt...@gmail.com Phone: +1(773)413-0202 Skype: mwojtow0202 ', '2010-11-23 05:25:36', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/2267df1e5fd8464b/e9051a923c15f593?show_docid=e9051a923c15f593', 1, 6)[0m

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-11-23 05:25:38', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 9)[0m

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability. I would like to have something presentable by April''s Chicago GTUG Here are some resources that I would like to begin with http://www.damonkohler.com/2009/02/android-recipes.html http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>No matter your level of expertise, If you are interested send me an email.  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>  Matthew K Wojtowicz Loyola Research Assistant Android Developer Mail: matt...@gmail.com Phone: +1(773)413-0202 Skype: mwojtow0202 ', '2010-11-23 05:30:22', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/2267df1e5fd8464b/e9051a923c15f593?show_docid=e9051a923c15f593', 1, 6)[0m

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-11-23 05:30:24', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 9)[0m

 I just realized that I forgot to share the code for this project with everyone. I haven''t set up in google code yet because the state of the code isn''t very good, but I''ve created a site in Google Sites with the prototype version. You can find that site here:http://sites.google.com/site/msilgc/If this project ever progresses further than where it stands right now, I''ll keep this site up to date.-joe', '2010-11-23 05:30:27', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/a828228d2f8e075d/ff94fac821d3868f?show_docid=ff94fac821d3868f', 1, 10)[0m

 All, I look forward to giving our presentation tonight. Attached is the final copy -- please let me know ASAP if you have any changes. I scheduled a room tonight, 25 East Pearson Maguire Hall (the same building where we have class) room *417*. I will be there as close to 5 PM as possible to review the presentation with all that can attend. I will take 1st and 2nd slides, the budget section, lessons learned, and the questions slide. Everyone else will have their respective sections. See you tonight, Pete

 All, Attached are the slides that Theja sent out earlier. After reviewing these slides, it looks like we need to do some major edits. We have 76 slides for a ~35 minute presentation. I ask all of you to cut down your parts of the presentation to *5 slides*. This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

 All, attached is the final version of our paper with the Executive Summary. Please be aware that all edits to this paper are due *this Sunday 7/12.* This is an important date to hit as Mitch will be compiling all edits to the paper and performing the final edit before we print this. I will be assisting him with this process. Please read the entire paper and make changes as appropriate. There is a lot of grammar that needs to be corrected as well as a deeper analysis of some sections. Each section should contain a closing paragraph where it is discussed what went right, what went wrong, and how it could be better. If your section does not have this information please add it by this Sunday. "Track Changes" is turned on for the document so any change you make will be marked red. Please keep this tracking on, save the document with a unique filename, and send to Mitch. Again,    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow making changes you    feel are necessary.    - By this Sunday night please post any changes you have to the Google    Group website and label the filename with your initials. Email the project    team letting Mitch and myself know that your section is complete. This is a    critical time to hit -- please do not miss this date.    - Please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Wednesday night    7/15 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. ***I pushed this date    back because we will not be presenting our analysis this Wednesday and this    will leave you more time to focus on the editing of the final paper.*** Thanks, Peter

 Hi Peter, Following are the questions regarding project control and tracking, 1. How the issues in ECM project are solved? whether a plan is prepared to solve it? 2. who will solve the issues? How do you allocate the time to solve it? 3. How the changes in ECM project are informed to team members? who notifies it? 4. Who & How do you ensure that the changes are implemented? 5. what are the actions taken when there is a change in your scope or quality or requirements? 6. who will do the analysis for changes? 7. who will approve or deny the changes? 8. Does the changes are documented? is there any change control form? 9. what are the impacts due to changes? 10. Does ECM have change control procedures? 11. Is there any change control board? if so, what are their responsibilities? 12. Is there any freeze date? 13. is there any project methodology? As a project manager what is your opinion about the methodology? is it useful? 14. is there any gating process? Once I get the answers for these questions, I will update the document. Regarding the project methodologies and templates, I searched in luc website, but it says that FILE NOT VIEWABLE by the public. so could you send me the document. -- Thank you so much, Thejashree Sengodan ', '2010-12-04 02:42:20', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/ccdb29592d0c4d1a/6541eb971e1a5685?show_docid=6541eb971e1a5685', 2, 18)[0m

 All, I uploaded a draft version of the final paper to the Google groups website and also attached it to this email. This version of the paper does NOT have the Executive Summary written. I am sending this doc so you can begin editing your section of the document ahead of time.    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow.    - By this Sunday please post any changes you have to the Google Group    website and label the filename with your initials.    - Please identify your changes in the doc so I know what to paste into    the master final paper. In addition, please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Sunday 7/12 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. Once this paper has been reviewed by everyone Mitch will perform the final edit of the paper. Thank you, Peter

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability. I would like to have something presentable by April''s Chicago GTUG Here are some resources that I would like to begin with http://www.damonkohler.com/2009/02/android-recipes.html http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>No matter your level of expertise, If you are interested send me an email.  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>  Matthew K Wojtowicz Loyola Research Assistant Android Developer Mail: matt...@gmail.com Phone: +1(773)413-0202 Skype: mwojtow0202 ', '2010-12-04 22:42:29', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/2267df1e5fd8464b/e9051a923c15f593?show_docid=e9051a923c15f593', 1, 6)[0m

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-12-04 22:42:31', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 9)[0m

 Steve, I would recommend that you go to http://www.cygwin.com/ and click on "Install Cygwin now". "Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows." "Note that Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the 1.7 version of Cygwin." Hopefully you don''t have Windows 7. From the setup program choose the compliers and text editors that you want.

 I just realized that I forgot to share the code for this project with everyone. I haven''t set up in google code yet because the state of the code isn''t very good, but I''ve created a site in Google Sites with the prototype version. You can find that site here:http://sites.google.com/site/msilgc/If this project ever progresses further than where it stands right now, I''ll keep this site up to date.-joe', '2010-12-04 22:42:34', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/a828228d2f8e075d/ff94fac821d3868f?show_docid=ff94fac821d3868f', 1, 10)[0m

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability.

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-12-04 22:45:43', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 9)[0m

 Steve, I would recommend that you go to http://www.cygwin.com/ and click on "Install Cygwin now". "Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows." "Note that Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the 1.7 version of Cygwin." Hopefully you don''t have Windows 7. From the setup program choose the compliers and text editors that you want. I believe "nano" is an easy text editor to use.Good luck, Mark', '2010-12-04 22:45:43', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 11)[0m

 Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error "cygwin1.dll is missing" if you attempt to do so.

 All, I look forward to giving our presentation tonight. Attached is the final copy -- please let me know ASAP if you have any changes. I scheduled a room tonight, 25 East Pearson Maguire Hall (the same building where we have class) room *417*. I will be there as close to 5 PM as possible to review the presentation with all that can attend. I will take 1st and 2nd slides, the budget section, lessons learned, and the questions slide. Everyone else will have their respective sections. See you tonight, Pete

 Hi Everyone:Here is the paper as of now.  There are still a lot of sentences that start with prepositions, passive sentences and verb tense disagreements.  I will continue working on the paper this evening and will send it out with as much as I can possible fix over the course of the evening.  I will add more to my critique section.  Please check your section and make sure the references are correct and that the Appendix references are correct.  Do not make your changes in the paper but simply email them to me as I will continue to make grammar changes.  Ken, please make sure all the citations in the Reference section are correct.Mitch', '2010-12-05 00:06:41', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/f62db74e89e5c7af/4cc6580cf2157345?show_docid=4cc6580cf2157345', 1, 6)[0m

 All, Attached are the slides that Theja sent out earlier. After reviewing these slides, it looks like we need to do some major edits. We have 76 slides for a ~35 minute presentation. I ask all of you to cut down your parts of the presentation to *5 slides*. This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

 All, attached is the final version of our paper with the Executive Summary. Please be aware that all edits to this paper are due *this Sunday 7/12.* This is an important date to hit as Mitch will be compiling all edits to the paper and performing the final edit before we print this. I will be assisting him with this process. Please read the entire paper and make changes as appropriate. There is a lot of grammar that needs to be corrected as well as a deeper analysis of some sections. Each section should contain a closing paragraph where it is discussed what went right, what went wrong, and how it could be better. If your section does not have this information please add it by this Sunday. "Track Changes" is turned on for the document so any change you make will be marked red. Please keep this tracking on, save the document with a unique filename, and send to Mitch. Again,    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow making changes you    feel are necessary.    - By this Sunday night please post any changes you have to the Google    Group website and label the filename with your initials. Email the project    team letting Mitch and myself know that your section is complete. This is a    critical time to hit -- please do not miss this date.    - Please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Wednesday night    7/15 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. ***I pushed this date    back because we will not be presenting our analysis this Wednesday and this    will leave you more time to focus on the editing of the final paper.*** Thanks, Peter

 Hi Peter, Following are the questions regarding project control and tracking, 1. How the issues in ECM project are solved? whether a plan is prepared to solve it? 2. who will solve the issues? How do you allocate the time to solve it? 3. How the changes in ECM project are informed to team members? who notifies it? 4. Who & How do you ensure that the changes are implemented? 5. what are the actions taken when there is a change in your scope or quality or requirements? 6. who will do the analysis for changes? 7. who will approve or deny the changes? 8. Does the changes are documented? is there any change control form? 9. what are the impacts due to changes? 10. Does ECM have change control procedures? 11. Is there any change control board? if so, what are their responsibilities? 12. Is there any freeze date? 13. is there any project methodology? As a project manager what is your opinion about the methodology? is it useful? 14. is there any gating process? Once I get the answers for these questions, I will update the document. Regarding the project methodologies and templates, I searched in luc website, but it says that FILE NOT VIEWABLE by the public. so could you send me the document. -- Thank you so much, Thejashree Sengodan ', '2010-12-05 00:06:50', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/ccdb29592d0c4d1a/6541eb971e1a5685?show_docid=6541eb971e1a5685', 1, 5)[0m

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability. I would like to have something presentable by April''s Chicago GTUG Here are some resources that I would like to begin with http://www.damonkohler.com/2009/02/android-recipes.html http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>No matter your level of expertise, If you are interested send me an email.  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>  Matthew K Wojtowicz Loyola Research Assistant Android Developer Mail: matt...@gmail.com Phone: +1(773)413-0202 Skype: mwojtow0202 ', '2010-12-05 07:18:47', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/2267df1e5fd8464b/e9051a923c15f593?show_docid=e9051a923c15f593', 1, 6)[0m

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-12-05 07:18:49', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 9)[0m

 Steve, I would recommend that you go to http://www.cygwin.com/ and click on "Install Cygwin now". "Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows." "Note that Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the 1.7 version of Cygwin." Hopefully you don''t have Windows 7. From the setup program choose the compliers and text editors that you want. I believe "nano" is an easy text editor to use.Good luck, Mark', '2010-12-05 07:18:49', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 1, 11)[0m

 I just realized that I forgot to share the code for this project with everyone. I haven''t set up in google code yet because the state of the code isn''t very good, but I''ve created a site in Google Sites with the prototype version. You can find that site here:http://sites.google.com/site/msilgc/If this project ever progresses further than where it stands right now, I''ll keep this site up to date.-joe', '2010-12-05 07:18:52', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/a828228d2f8e075d/ff94fac821d3868f?show_docid=ff94fac821d3868f', 1, 10)[0m

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability. I would like to have something presentable by April''s Chicago GTUG Here are some resources that I would like to begin with http://www.damonkohler.com/2009/02/android-recipes.html http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>No matter your level of expertise, If you are interested send me an email.  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>  Matthew K Wojtowicz Loyola Research Assistant Android Developer Mail: matt...@gmail.com Phone: +1(773)413-0202 Skype: mwojtow0202 ', '2010-12-05 07:21:57', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/2267df1e5fd8464b/e9051a923c15f593?show_docid=e9051a923c15f593', 4, 6)[0m

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-12-05 07:21:59', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 4, 9)[0m

 Steve, I would recommend that you go to http://www.cygwin.com/ and click on "Install Cygwin now". "Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows." "Note that Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the 1.7 version of Cygwin." Hopefully you don''t have Windows 7. From the setup program choose the compliers and text editors that you want. I believe "nano" is an easy text editor to use.Good luck, Mark', '2010-12-05 07:21:59', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 4, 11)[0m

 Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error "cygwin1.dll is missing" if you attempt to do so.

 I just realized that I forgot to share the code for this project with everyone. I haven''t set up in google code yet because the state of the code isn''t very good, but I''ve created a site in Google Sites with the prototype version. You can find that site here:http://sites.google.com/site/msilgc/If this project ever progresses further than where it stands right now, I''ll keep this site up to date.-joe', '2010-12-05 07:22:01', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/a828228d2f8e075d/ff94fac821d3868f?show_docid=ff94fac821d3868f', 4, 10)[0m

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability.

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-12-07 07:24:20', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 5, 9)[0m

 Just an update: I sort of combined all of your suggestions for my C working environment. I''m using Notepad++ for my text editor (thanks Matthew) and Cygwin and a GCC compiler to compile and run my programs. Thanks again for your help guys! Happy Holidays.

 Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error "cygwin1.dll is missing" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

 All, I look forward to giving our presentation tonight. Attached is the final copy -- please let me know ASAP if you have any changes. I scheduled a room tonight, 25 East Pearson Maguire Hall (the same building where we have class) room *417*. I will be there as close to 5 PM as possible to review the presentation with all that can attend. I will take 1st and 2nd slides, the budget section, lessons learned, and the questions slide. Everyone else will have their respective sections. See you tonight, Pete

 Hi Everyone:Here is the paper as of now.  There are still a lot of sentences that start with prepositions, passive sentences and verb tense disagreements.  I will continue working on the paper this evening and will send it out with as much as I can possible fix over the course of the evening.  I will add more to my critique section.  Please check your section and make sure the references are correct and that the Appendix references are correct.  Do not make your changes in the paper but simply email them to me as I will continue to make grammar changes.  Ken, please make sure all the citations in the Reference section are correct.Mitch', '2010-12-07 07:38:19', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/f62db74e89e5c7af/4cc6580cf2157345?show_docid=4cc6580cf2157345', 6, 19)[0m

 All, Attached are the slides that Theja sent out earlier. After reviewing these slides, it looks like we need to do some major edits. We have 76 slides for a ~35 minute presentation. I ask all of you to cut down your parts of the presentation to *5 slides*. This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

 All, I will not be able to attend class tonight, professor has been notified.Peter, I was wondering if we were going to all get together to practice our presentation?I am a little concern because based on the corrections made on the draft, I might not be understanding some of my section.  I research all my material from the documents given on docxchanger and the loyola ITS websites.  I just want to make sure that I wrote the correct information for the presentation.thanks

 All, attached is the final version of our paper with the Executive Summary. Please be aware that all edits to this paper are due *this Sunday 7/12.* This is an important date to hit as Mitch will be compiling all edits to the paper and performing the final edit before we print this. I will be assisting him with this process. Please read the entire paper and make changes as appropriate. There is a lot of grammar that needs to be corrected as well as a deeper analysis of some sections. Each section should contain a closing paragraph where it is discussed what went right, what went wrong, and how it could be better. If your section does not have this information please add it by this Sunday. "Track Changes" is turned on for the document so any change you make will be marked red. Please keep this tracking on, save the document with a unique filename, and send to Mitch. Again,    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow making changes you    feel are necessary.    - By this Sunday night please post any changes you have to the Google    Group website and label the filename with your initials. Email the project    team letting Mitch and myself know that your section is complete. This is a    critical time to hit -- please do not miss this date.    - Please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Wednesday night    7/15 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. ***I pushed this date    back because we will not be presenting our analysis this Wednesday and this    will leave you more time to focus on the editing of the final paper.*** Thanks, Peter

 Hi Peter, Following are the questions regarding project control and tracking, 1. How the issues in ECM project are solved? whether a plan is prepared to solve it? 2. who will solve the issues? How do you allocate the time to solve it? 3. How the changes in ECM project are informed to team members? who notifies it? 4. Who & How do you ensure that the changes are implemented? 5. what are the actions taken when there is a change in your scope or quality or requirements? 6. who will do the analysis for changes? 7. who will approve or deny the changes? 8. Does the changes are documented? is there any change control form? 9. what are the impacts due to changes? 10. Does ECM have change control procedures? 11. Is there any change control board? if so, what are their responsibilities? 12. Is there any freeze date? 13. is there any project methodology? As a project manager what is your opinion about the methodology? is it useful? 14. is there any gating process? Once I get the answers for these questions, I will update the document. Regarding the project methodologies and templates, I searched in luc website, but it says that FILE NOT VIEWABLE by the public. so could you send me the document. -- Thank you so much, Thejashree Sengodan ', '2010-12-07 07:38:27', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/ccdb29592d0c4d1a/6541eb971e1a5685?show_docid=6541eb971e1a5685', 6, 18)[0m

 Well as I have been getting deeper into the Android library, I have begun to notice a few things.    - I am repeating a lot of code for common tasks(db, barcode, gps,... )    - Common place for instruction  is not found (I use google, blogs,    stackoverflow,...)    - Books talk technical not practical of if so not usefully("this is how    you take a picture", but I want to change the quality and size too)    - Android documentation is BAD!(There love of the complex design doesn''t    help) What I propose is a one-stop resource for all your android needs. This includes helper/fascade code, proper documentation, example code, and meaningful tutorials. Resources will be posted onto google''s hosting probability. I would like to have something presentable by April''s Chicago GTUG Here are some resources that I would like to begin with http://www.damonkohler.com/2009/02/android-recipes.html http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>No matter your level of expertise, If you are interested send me an email.  <http://code.google.com/p/android-tools/>  Matthew K Wojtowicz Loyola Research Assistant Android Developer Mail: matt...@gmail.com Phone: +1(773)413-0202 Skype: mwojtow0202 ', '2010-12-07 08:50:32', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/2267df1e5fd8464b/e9051a923c15f593?show_docid=e9051a923c15f593', 4, 6)[0m

 Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

 Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James', '2010-12-07 08:50:34', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/8512f14e01dcdbaf/1cc140bb840ea675?show_docid=1cc140bb840ea675', 4, 9)[0m

 Steve, I would recommend that you go to http://www.cygwin.com/ and click on "Install Cygwin now". "Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows." "Note that Windows 7 and later will only be supported starting with the 1.7 version of Cygwin." Hopefully you don''t have Windows 7. From the setup program choose the compliers and text editors that you want.

 I just realized that I forgot to share the code for this project with everyone. I haven''t set up in google code yet because the state of the code isn''t very good, but I''ve created a site in Google Sites with the prototype version. You can find that site here:http://sites.google.com/site/msilgc/If this project ever progresses further than where it stands right now, I''ll keep this site up to date.-joe', '2010-12-07 08:50:37', 'http://groups.google.com/group/luc-cs-hpc-f09/browse_thread/thread/a828228d2f8e075d/ff94fac821d3868f?show_docid=ff94fac821d3868f', 4, 10)[0m

 All, I look forward to giving our presentation tonight. Attached is the final copy -- please let me know ASAP if you have any changes. I scheduled a room tonight, 25 East Pearson Maguire Hall (the same building where we have class) room *417*. I will be there as close to 5 PM as possible to review the presentation with all that can attend. I will take 1st and 2nd slides, the budget section, lessons learned, and the questions slide. Everyone else will have their respective sections. See you tonight, Pete

 Hi Everyone:Here is the paper as of now.  There are still a lot of sentences that start with prepositions, passive sentences and verb tense disagreements.  I will continue working on the paper this evening and will send it out with as much as I can possible fix over the course of the evening.  I will add more to my critique section.  Please check your section and make sure the references are correct and that the Appendix references are correct.  Do not make your changes in the paper but simply email them to me as I will continue to make grammar changes.  Ken, please make sure all the citations in the Reference section are correct.Mitch', '2010-12-07 10:03:08', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/f62db74e89e5c7af/4cc6580cf2157345?show_docid=4cc6580cf2157345', 4, 6)[0m

 All, Attached are the slides that Theja sent out earlier. After reviewing these slides, it looks like we need to do some major edits. We have 76 slides for a ~35 minute presentation. I ask all of you to cut down your parts of the presentation to *5 slides*. This will help reduce the number of slides in half and it will also ensure our presentation doesn''t go over our alloted time. I recommend: 1) Only using bullet points and images in your slides. Remember, these are just talking points and that our audience will not be reading the slides. Images will help reduce the number of words you need... just reference your picture. 2) Do not use sentences. Use short statements. 3) Do not copy and paste directly from our final paper. Just list the overall themes from your section. You will be speaking in great detail and we don''t need it duplicated on the screen. Please send Theja your updated slides by this Friday. Only send her your 5 slides (or less). Do not send her the attached file with your edits as that will make collection very confusing. Thank you, Peter

 All, attached is the final version of our paper with the Executive Summary. Please be aware that all edits to this paper are due *this Sunday 7/12.* This is an important date to hit as Mitch will be compiling all edits to the paper and performing the final edit before we print this. I will be assisting him with this process. Please read the entire paper and make changes as appropriate. There is a lot of grammar that needs to be corrected as well as a deeper analysis of some sections. Each section should contain a closing paragraph where it is discussed what went right, what went wrong, and how it could be better. If your section does not have this information please add it by this Sunday. "Track Changes" is turned on for the document so any change you make will be marked red. Please keep this tracking on, save the document with a unique filename, and send to Mitch. Again,    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow making changes you    feel are necessary.    - By this Sunday night please post any changes you have to the Google    Group website and label the filename with your initials. Email the project    team letting Mitch and myself know that your section is complete. This is a    critical time to hit -- please do not miss this date.    - Please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Wednesday night    7/15 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. ***I pushed this date    back because we will not be presenting our analysis this Wednesday and this    will leave you more time to focus on the editing of the final paper.*** Thanks, Peter

 Hi Peter, Following are the questions regarding project control and tracking, 1. How the issues in ECM project are solved? whether a plan is prepared to solve it? 2. who will solve the issues? How do you allocate the time to solve it? 3. How the changes in ECM project are informed to team members? who notifies it? 4. Who & How do you ensure that the changes are implemented? 5. what are the actions taken when there is a change in your scope or quality or requirements? 6. who will do the analysis for changes? 7. who will approve or deny the changes? 8. Does the changes are documented? is there any change control form? 9. what are the impacts due to changes? 10. Does ECM have change control procedures? 11. Is there any change control board? if so, what are their responsibilities? 12. Is there any freeze date? 13. is there any project methodology? As a project manager what is your opinion about the methodology? is it useful? 14. is there any gating process? Once I get the answers for these questions, I will update the document. Regarding the project methodologies and templates, I searched in luc website, but it says that FILE NOT VIEWABLE by the public. so could you send me the document. -- Thank you so much, Thejashree Sengodan ', '2010-12-07 10:03:16', 'http://groups.google.com/group/project-management-ecm/browse_thread/thread/ccdb29592d0c4d1a/6541eb971e1a5685?show_docid=6541eb971e1a5685', 4, 5)[0m

 All, I uploaded a draft version of the final paper to the Google groups website and also attached it to this email. This version of the paper does NOT have the Executive Summary written. I am sending this doc so you can begin editing your section of the document ahead of time.    - Please review this draft final paper and thoroughly read not only your    section but the section of others for accuracy and flow.    - By this Sunday please post any changes you have to the Google Group    website and label the filename with your initials.    - Please identify your changes in the doc so I know what to paste into    the master final paper. In addition, please email your PowerPoint slides to Theja by this Sunday 7/12 so she can create the PowerPoint presentation. Once this paper has been reviewed by everyone Mitch will perform the final edit of the paper. Thank you, Peter
