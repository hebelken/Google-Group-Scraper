- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- "Just an update: I sort of combined all of your suggestions for my C working environment. I''m using Notepad++ for my text editor (thanks Matthew) and Cygwin and a GCC compiler to compile and run my programs. Thanks again for your help guys! Happy Holidays."
- "Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error \"cygwin1.dll is missing\" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- "Just an update: I sort of combined all of your suggestions for my C working environment. I''m using Notepad++ for my text editor (thanks Matthew) and Cygwin and a GCC compiler to compile and run my programs. Thanks again for your help guys! Happy Holidays."
- "Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error \"cygwin1.dll is missing\" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

- "Dear All: I am writing this e-mail on behalf of Dr. Honig, who is teaching the Microcomputer Design course next term. Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K. Thiruvathukal, Ph.D. - http://www.thiruvathukal.com"

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James
- Notepad ++ is a good text edtior for windows.For C I would recommend using a gcc to compile your files.On Dec 14, 2009 12:03 AM, "SteveJMarist" <sjam...@luc.edu> wrote:Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far.

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- Hey guys, hope everyone is enjoying their winter break so far. I had a question about something and thought this would be a nice place to get it out there. With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS. Any recommendations-- including text editors for C on Windows 64-bit platform-- you guys could give me would be greatly appreciated. Hope everyone has a great Xmas.-- Steve James

- "Just an update: I sort of combined all of your suggestions for my C working environment. I''m using Notepad++ for my text editor (thanks Matthew) and Cygwin and a GCC compiler to compile and run my programs. Thanks again for your help guys! Happy Holidays."
- "Do you guys know of a way around running a cygwin-built app outside of cygwin? As I''m sure you know, you get the error \"cygwin1.dll is missing\" if you attempt to do so. I''m assuming it isn''t possible to run it outside of cygwin, but if there is a way around it it would be nice to know.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now.

With the few weeks we have, I''ve been inspired by Steve and Ken to learn C; however, I''m having significant trouble figuring out how to use Visual Studio 2008 to compile C source code (msdn''s tutorial says something about using the "notepad" command, but VS isn''t recognizing the command). I also tried installing Dev- C++ but apparently it''s not compatible with a 64-bit OS.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.

Given the significant number of students who were interested in hardware and hacking in general in this course, I would like to encourage you to sign up for this course. There are presently only 8 students enrolled, and in general a course needs 10 students to be assured of making the cut. I hope that a couple of students from the HPC course would be willing to enroll. Dr. Honig''s classes are usually project-oriented and fun, so I am assuming that this class will be manageable for most of you, now that you have survived the HPC experience. It is very important to me, personally, that this course not be cancelled. I am working hard to take the department in new directions that emphasize systems and engineering and have been working with William to grow this area for a few years now. So I hope you''ll respond to the call and find a way to add this class to your schedule for next term. George -- George K.
